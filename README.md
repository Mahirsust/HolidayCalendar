<h1> My(mahirsust) and mypartner(meem94) First Android project </h1>
<p>
 Created a 'Classroom management' website for my department. It shows routines, academic resources,
results, notices and curriculum of different semesters. Teachers can add, edit, delete the resources and
students can view them. I have used Laravel 5.3, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP and MYSQL database
here.
